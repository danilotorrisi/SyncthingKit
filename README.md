## Introduction

SyncthingKit is a simple wrapper for the Syncthing [REST APIs](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/wiki/REST-Interface).

[Syncthing](http://syncthing.net) is a Dropbox-like service that can be used to sync and backup your data between your devices without having to upload to anyones cloud.

The pod is highly experimental, it probably won't even work in your Mac, I still have to fix a few issues.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

- Be myself, have my computer, run in my home directory ( Just kidding but right now I had to hard-cod something to make it work for my environment, sorry about that I will fix it ASAP ).
- OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 or higher
- Syncthing 0.10.x or higher ( it would probably work even on previous versions ) 

## Installation

SyncthingKit will be available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "SyncthingKit"
